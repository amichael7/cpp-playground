# C++ Playground

This is some experiments in writing toy projects in C++, trying to improve my skills.

I'm following along with [Stanford CS106L Fall 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WvkljZzGug&list=PLCgD3ws8aVdolCexlz8f3U-RROA0s5jWA) 
which is an seminar-style intro to the C++ language.  As I go along, I'm sure, the code in here will become more expressive.
